Overview
=========================================================
A project to predict housing prices in the five boroughs of New York through regression. It utilizes RandomForestRegressor from scikit learn, and housing data from 2015-2020 on the `nyc housing data site <https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-annualized-sales-update.page>`_.

The generate/generate_random scripts read, clean, and generate files for the `deployed version <https://github.com/MonkeyDoug/Streamlit-Housing-Regression>`_, one with a controlled random_state for optimizing accuracy, and the other generates completely random models and train_test data for the deployed version. 

The purpose of this project was not to create the most accurate predictions but to help me learn more about machine learning and gain experience with pandas, scikit learn, etc. Do not use the values generated by the model as any type of financial advice.
